# Problem 1: Missing Information in Output JSON Files

## Problem Description

The output JSON files generated by the enrichment pipeline (e.g., `metabolite_enriched_data.json`, `metabolite_enriched_data_by_name.json` in various output directories) are missing key information for some metabolites. This missing data includes fields such as HMDB IDs, PubChem IDs, names, or other expected enrichment results. The incomplete output limits downstream analysis and integration with other datasets.

## Plan

1. **Identify** which fields are missing and for which metabolites.
2. **Trace** the enrichment pipeline to determine where and why data is lost or not filled.
3. **Improve** data retrieval and error handling in the enrichment scripts.
4. **Validate** the output after changes to ensure completeness.

## What Was Tried

- Examined the enrichment scripts (`metabolite_data_enricher.py`, `pubchem_data_retriever.py`, etc.) for logic gaps and error handling.
- Added logging to track which metabolites fail to retrieve data.
- Ran the enrichment pipeline on test datasets to compare input and output.
- Checked cache and lookup mechanisms for missing or outdated entries.

## What Worked

- Logging helped identify specific metabolites and fields that were consistently missing.
- Updating cache files and re-running the pipeline restored some missing data.
- Improving error handling for network/API failures reduced the number of empty fields.

## What Failed

- Some metabolites still lack information due to ambiguous or missing identifiers in the input.
- Occasional API timeouts or rate limits still cause incomplete enrichment.
- Not all edge cases (e.g., synonyms, alternate IDs) are handled robustly.

## Next Steps

1. Enhance input validation and identifier normalization.
2. Implement retries and fallback strategies for API calls.
3. Expand synonym and alternate ID mapping.
4. Add unit tests to cover edge cases.
5. Review and document all changes for reproducibility.
