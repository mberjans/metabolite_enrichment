# Problem 6: Summary File Generation and Single Metabolite Enrichment

## Problem Description
The enrichment workflow was not generating summary JSON files (`metabolite_enriched_data_by_name.json` and `metabolite_enriched_data.json`) in recent runs. Additionally, we needed to validate and test single-metabolite enrichment functionality with the improved PubChem parsing.

## Plan and Approach
1. Investigate why summary files were not being generated
2. Restore and validate summary file generation logic
3. Test single-metabolite enrichment functionality
4. Ensure all files are generated in the correct output directory

## Actions Taken

### 1. Code Analysis and Fixes
- Examined main workflow script (`run_full_enrichment_with_improved_pubchem.py`)
- Found that summary file generation calls were missing after enrichment
- Added summary file generation calls in both single and batch modes
- Updated save methods to respect output directory parameter
- Added backup file creation with timestamps
- Fixed function signatures and documentation

### 2. Code Changes Made
- Added `save_enriched_data_to_json` and `save_enriched_data_by_name_to_json` calls after processing
- Updated save methods to accept output directory parameter
- Implemented backup file creation with timestamps
- Fixed argument handling in main workflow script

### 3. Testing Setup
- Prepared to test single-metabolite enrichment with Glycine
- Set up virtual environment and dependencies
- Added required packages including pubchempy
- Created test directory (Glycine_output) for results

## What Worked
- Successfully identified missing summary file generation calls
- Fixed and restored summary file generation logic
- Implemented proper output directory handling
- Added backup file creation functionality
- Successfully committed code changes to git

## What Did Not Work
- Initial attempts to run the script without proper dependency setup
- Task management tools had issues with missing task configuration
- Git push command was not available in the tool set

## Current Status
- Code changes are committed and ready
- Environment is prepared for testing
- Ready to execute single-metabolite enrichment for Glycine

## Next Steps
1. Execute the enrichment command for Glycine:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/Mark/Research/Personalized_nutrition/metabolitereport
   source venv/bin/activate
   python src/run_full_enrichment_with_improved_pubchem.py --single-metabolite Glycine --output-dir Glycine_output
   ```

2. Verify the output:
   - Check that files are generated in Glycine_output directory
   - Validate the structure of generated JSON files
   - Confirm that backup files are created with timestamps

3. If successful with Glycine:
   - Test with additional single metabolites
   - Run batch mode enrichment
   - Verify all summary files are generated correctly

4. Document any issues or improvements needed
   - Update documentation with successful test results
   - Note any performance or reliability improvements needed
   - Document any edge cases discovered during testing

## Dependencies
Required packages for running the enrichment script:
- All packages from requirements.txt
- pubchempy (additional requirement for PubChem access)
- Properly configured virtual environment

## Notes
- The script now handles both single-metabolite and batch modes
- Output directory is configurable via --output-dir parameter
- Backup files are automatically created with timestamps
- Both HMDB ID-based and name-based summary files are generated
