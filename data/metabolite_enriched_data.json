      "compound_description": "Glycine appears as white crystals. (NTP, 1992) Glycine is the simplest (and the only achiral) proteinogenic amino acid, with a hydrogen atom as its side chain. It has a role as a nutraceutical, a hepatoprotective agent, an EC 2.1.2.1 (glycine hydroxymethyltransferase) inhibitor, a NMDA receptor agonist, a micronutrient, a fundamental metabolite and a neurotransmitter. It is an alpha-amino acid, a serine family amino acid and a proteinogenic amino acid. It is a conjugate base of a glycinium. It is a conjugate acid of a glycinate. It is a tautomer of a glycine zwitterion. A non-essential amino acid. It is found primarily in gelatin and silk fibroin and used therapeutically as a nutrient. It is also a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glycine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655). Glycine has been reported in Microchloropsis, Pinus densiflora, and other organisms with data available. Glycine is a non-essential, non-polar, non-optical, glucogenic amino acid. Glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, triggers chloride ion influx via ionotropic receptors, thereby creating an inhibitory post-synaptic potential. In contrast, this agent also acts as a co-agonist, along with glutamate, facilitating an excitatory potential at the glutaminergic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. Glycine is an important component and precursor for many macromolecules in the cells. GLYCINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) and has 12 investigational indications. Glycine is a simple, nonessential amino acid, although experimental animals show reduced growth on low-glycine diets. The average adult ingests 3 to 5 grams of glycine daily. Glycine is involved in the body's production of DNA, phospholipids and collagen, and in release of energy. Glycine levels are effectively measured in plasma in both normal patients and those with inborn errors of glycine metabolism. Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (OMIM 606899) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (EC 2.1.1.10). The glycine cleavage enzyme system comprises four proteins: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins (EC 1.4.4.2, EC 2.1.2.10 and EC 1.8.1.4 for P-, T- and L-proteins). Mutations have been described in the GLDC (OMIM 238300), AMT (OMIM 238310), and GCSH (OMIM 238330) genes encoding the P-, T-, and H-proteins respectively. The glycine cleavage system catalyses the oxidative conversion of glycine into carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the remaining one-carbon unit transferred to folate as methylenetetrahydrofolate. It is the main catabolic pathway for glycine and it also contributes to one-carbon metabolism. Patients with a deficiency of this enzyme system have increased glycine in plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an increased CSF: plasma glycine ratio.  (A3412). t is also a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter. A non-essential amino acid. It is found primarily in gelatin and silk fibroin and used therapeutically as a nutrient. It is also a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter. See also: Glycine Hydrochloride (has salt form); Amlisimod (monomer of); ProSol (FDA NDC: 0338-0499) (component of) ...

The strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding site is located on the NMDA receptor complex. The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor complex is comprised of a chloride channel and is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. The putative antispastic activity of supplemental glycine could be mediated by glycine's binding to strychnine-sensitive binding sites in the spinal cord. This would result in increased chloride conductance and consequent enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission. The ability of glycine to potentiate NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission raised the possibility of its use in the management of neuroleptic-resistant negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Animal studies indicate that supplemental glycine protects against endotoxin-induced lethality, hypoxia-reperfusion injury after liver transplantation, and D-galactosamine-mediated liver injury. Neutrophils are thought to participate in these pathologic processes via invasion of tissue and releasing such reactive oxygen species as superoxide. In vitro studies have shown that neutrophils contain a glycine-gated chloride channel that can attenuate increases in intracellular calcium and diminsh neutrophil oxidant production. This research is ealy-stage, but suggests that supplementary glycine may turn out to be useful in processes where neutrophil infiltration contributes to toxicity, such as ARDS.

      "compound_description": "(S)-lactic acid is an optically active form of lactic acid having (S)-configuration. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a human metabolite. It is a 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and a (2S)-2-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-lactate. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-lactic acid. L-Lactic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655). L-Lactic acid has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, and other organisms with data available. Lactic Acid, L- is the levorotatory isomer of lactic acid, the biologically active isoform in humans.  Lactic acid or lactate is produced during fermentation from pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase. This reaction, in addition to producing lactic acid, also produces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) that is then used in glycolysis to produce energy source adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Lactic acid plays a role in several biochemical processes and is produced in the muscles during intense activity. Lactate measurement in the critically ill has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcome. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms such as man who are forced to produce ATP for their integrity adapt in many different ways up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow the cell to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may therefore be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state.  A number of studies have demonstrated that malignant transformation is associated with an increase in glycolytic flux and in anaerobic and aerobic cellular lactate excretion. Using quantitative bioluminescence imaging in various primary carcinomas in patients (uterine cervix, head and neck, colorectal region) at first diagnosis of the disease, lactate concentrations in tumors in vivo could be relatively low or extremely high (up to 40 micromol/g) in different individual tumors or within the same lesion. In all tumor entities investigated, high molar concentrations of lactate were correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis already in an early stage of the disease. Low lactate tumors (< median of approximately 8 micromol/g) were associated with both a longer overall and disease free survival compared to high lactate lesions (lactate > approximately 8 micromol/g). Lactate dehydrogenase was found to be upregulated in most of these tumors compared to surrounding normal tissue.  (A3333, A3334). D-Lactic acid is the end product of the enzyme Glyoxalase II ([EC:3.1.2.6] hydroxyacyl-glutathione hydrolase) which converts the intermediate substrate S-lactoyl-glutathione to reduced glutathione and D-lactate. (OMIM 138790). The concentrated form is used internally to prevent gastrointestinal fermentation. L-Lactic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A normal intermediate in the fermentation (oxidation, metabolism) of sugar. The concentrated form is used internally to prevent gastrointestinal fermentation.
